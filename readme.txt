Project 1
Name: John Isril
ID Number: 75516693

This project was written in C++. It can be compiled and executed with the following commands.
1) Enter "g++ -o main *.cpp" into the command line to compile and produce an executable called main.exe. 
   I've included the main.exe so you don't need to do this compilation.
2) To redirect input from an input file and write to an output file, enter "main < input.txt > output.txt".
    You can also just open main.exe and type in commands from the standard console input, then it will 
     output to the standard console output.
